# Food Supply Chain Tracker

A decentralized event-driven system for tracking goods across multiple stakeholders in a supply chain.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of goods across the supply chain
- Role-based access control for different stakeholders
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Inventory management with alerts
- Analytics dashboard
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Multi-tenant support

## Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- Inventory Service: Manages products and inventory levels
- Shipment Service: Handles shipment tracking and status updates
- API Gateway: Routes requests and handles authentication
- Frontend: Vue.js dashboard for visualization and management

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Go (Golang) 1.21+
  - Standard library for HTTP servers
  - gorilla/mux for routing
  - GORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL 15+ for data storage
- NATS for event streaming
- Docker & Kubernetes for deployment

### Frontend
- Vue.js 3
  - Composition API
  - Vue Router
  - Vuex for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for analytics
- Leaflet for maps
- Axios for HTTP requests

### Infrastructure
- Docker & Docker Compose for local development
- Kubernetes for production deployment
- Helm for package management
- PostgreSQL with multi-tenant support
- NATS with JetStream enabled

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15+
- NATS Server
- Make
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahmanazhar/FoodSupplyChain.git
   cd FoodSupplyChain
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   make dev-deps
   go mod download
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/foodsupplychain
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   make docker-compose-up
   ```

5. Run the services:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   make run

   # In another terminal
   cd frontend/foodsupplychain
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Commands

- `make build`: Build all services
- `make test`: Run tests
- `make lint`: Run linter
